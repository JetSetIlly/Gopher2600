Gopher2600 is an emulator for the Atari 2600. Accuracy is very high and and there are no known problems with the emulation of the 6507, TIA or RIOT chips.

The emulator is suitable for both playing 2600 games and for developing new games. In particular, the debugging features available for developers of CDFJ, DPC+ and ELF type cartridges (cartridges that make use of an ARM coprocessor) are unique.

Most ["bank switching"](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Supported-Cartridge-Mappers) types are supported, including the above mentioned CDFJ, DPC+ and ELF types. Also notable is the support for [Supercharger](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Supercharger) and in particular, the loading of Supercharger tapes stored as a WAV or MP3 file. Also supported is the [Movie Cart](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Movie-Cart)

Games using [PlusROM](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/PlusROM) features are also supported.

The [AtariVox and SaveKey](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/AtariVox-and-SaveKey) peripherals are emulated. Uniquely, the AtariVox voice features can be emulated with the third-party application `Festival`. Although the voice reproduction is imperfect, it is helpful to hear feedback for AtariVox voice commands. A subtitler for the AtariVox voice output is also available. Again, this is imperfect and only shows phonetic spellings.

The vintage CRT television, contemporaneous with the console, is emulated with a selection of interference effects and bevel images. This is an ongoing area of development and will be improved further in the future.

Flexible [screenshot](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Creating-Screenshots) features so that games using "flicker" kernels can be effectively captured.

Accurate audio reproduction with optional stereo output. The intensity of the stereo effect can be altered.

Over the course of its lifetime, the Atari2600 came in several versions which introduced subtle variations in the TIA chip. Gopher2600 supports the common [TIA revisions](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/TIA-Revisions)

For the player who wants to master a game quickly there is convenient [gameplay rewinding](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Rewinding). The rewinding feature is also available in the emulator's debugger in the form of a "timeline" window.

Gameplay can also be [recorded and played back](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Recording-Gamplay). In addition to keeping gameplay sessions for future study or enjoyment, recordings are also useful for testing purposes during game development.

The standard controllers are supported. The joystick, the paddle, the keypad and also Sega Genesis style [controllers](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Hand-Controllers-and-Front-Panel).

The graphical [debugger](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Debugger) provides a powerful interface to the internals of the Atari 2600. The state of the console can be inspected and rewound at the CPU and Colour Clock level. Breakpoints and watches can be set on many areas of the CPU, TIA and RIOT and the same areas can be be peeked and poked as required.

In addition to the graphical windows of the debugger, a terminal interface is provided.

The most powerful use of the debugger however is the debugging and profiling of cartridges that use an ARM coprocessor (Harmony, PlusCart, etc.) When the game to be debugged is [compiled correctly](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Preparing-ARM-Enabled-Projects-for-the-Gopher2600-Debugger) Gopher2600 can use the DWARF information to  profile performance; to identify incorrect code flow; and to identify incorrect use of the program's global and local variables.

## Basic Usage

Launching the emulator from the desktop or command line will open the emulator in `playmode`. The ROM selector allows you to select a 2600 ROM file from your collection. The ROM selector can be opened at any time by pressing the `TAB` key.

For joystick games, player one can be controlled with the keyboard - using cursor keys and the space bar for fire. Alternatively, any attached gamepad can be used. For games that do not use a joystick see the [controllers wiki entry](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki/Hand-Controllers-and-Front-Panel) for more details. This page also lists the keys for the console's panel switches.

The preferences window can be opened by pressing the `F10` key. Amongst other settings, the television can be adjusted from this window and in particular, the CRT effects can be changed or disabled if necessary.

Finally, the debugger can be activated by pressing the backquote `` ` `` key. 

All other documentation and help for Gopher2600 is listed in the following section.

## Documentation and Help

User documentation for the emulator can be found in the project [wiki](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Docs/wiki).

Development & Maintenance documentation can be found in the [Gopher2600-Dev-Docs repository](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600-Dev-Docs/).

Source level documentation can be found on the [Go package documentation site](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jetsetilly/gopher2600).

There is also a project [blog](https://jetsetilly.github.io/Gopher2600-Blog/) which will be updated periodically with topical articles. 

## Resources used

The Stella project (https://stella-emu.github.io/) was used as a visual
reference for video output. In the absence of VCS hardware (which I didn't have
during initial TIA development) Stella was a good alternative for checking
the accuracy of video output.

In addition, Stella was used as reference in the following areas:

* During the development of the CDF cartridge formats. These recent formats don't
seem to be documented anywhere accept in the Stella source.

* Cartridge fingerprints for ParkerBros, Wickstead Design, SCABS, UA and JANE.

* As a reference for the audio implementation (the 6502.ts project was also
  referenced for this reason).

* Fingerprint patterns for automated controller/peripheral selection.

In all these instances, primary sources of information could not be found.

(Earlier revision of Gopher2600 used Stella a reference for the EF cartridge
format. However, the implementation has been vastly simplified by declaring EF
to be a nothing more than a 64k Atari ROM. The discussion that led to this
revelation can be found in the link below.)

Many notes and clues from the AtariAge message boards. Most significantly the
following threads proved very useful indeed:

* "Cosmic Ark Star Field Revisited"
* "Properly model NUSIZ during player decode and draw"
* "Requesting help in improving TIA emulation in Stella" 
* "3F Bankswitching"
* "TIA Sounding Off in the Digital Domain"

And from and old mailing list:

* "Games that do bad things to HMOVE..." https://www.biglist.com/lists/stella/archives/199804/msg00198.html

These mailing lists and forums have supplied me with many useful test ROMs. I
aim to package these up and distribute them sometime in the future (assuming I
can get the required permissions).
