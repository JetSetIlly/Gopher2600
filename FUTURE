debugger
--------

o RESET command to work when mid-instruction (during video step)

o custom error messages for command line package
	- for example "unrecognised argument" command for HELP should be something
	  like "no help available for ..."

o resolve symbols for WATCH command
	- and probably BREAK, TRAP commands

o a way of specifying where to stop when manually breaking (with ctrl-c)
	- so, continue to this scanline before stopping
	- set break with mouse should set this manual breakpoint rather than the
	  current behaviour (adding to the list of auto-breaks)

o a way of outputting information at a particular point if the information has
changed since the last iteration
	- for example: "player 0" at scanline 150 if changed
	- ONDIFF command?

o LAST to include additional information
	- such as, what memory address was touched.
	- defaults to CPU instruction like now but optional arguments to output
	  different LAST information. for example: LAST MEM

o commandline
	- custom placeholders. for example:
	
		PEEK %address

	 would validate true only if it passes a custom test for %address

o display of colors in the terminal (check for 256 color terminal)

o MachineInfoDebug() in addition to Terse and Verbose

vcs
---

o randomised initialisation

o optional to prevent regression tests from failing


sdl screen
----------

o info under mouse. floating tooltip


regression db
-------------

o running tests that match NOTES field (with regex?)

o multiple arguments for DELETE

o a way of adding notes to an entry after it has been added

o SORT BY argument for LIST

o better separation of database and regression packages

o lock file

o progress meter for "frame" entry type

o CLEAN mode
	- removes entries where ROMs or script file is missing
	- removes orphaned script files

o parallel execution of tests
