accuracy questions
------------------

o accuracy of cosmic stars
	- cosmic 3 stars
    - cosmic ark itself

o resetDuringHmove/missile/10.bin

o resetDuringHmove/player/07.bin

o extra hmove clock on Phi2 instead of Phi1 (latter documented in TIA_HW_Notes)

o player stretching on LatePhi1 and LatePhi2 rather than the rising edge

o in the sprite resetPosition() function there is a condition in which the
second part doesn't seem to apply in Z26 v4.07 . unsure if Stella or Z26 is
more accurate

	if ps.startDrawingEvent != nil && !ps.startDrawingEvent.AboutToEnd() {
		ps.startDrawingEvent.Pause()
	}


hiscore server support
----------------------

to complete


debugger
--------

o RESET command to work when mid-instruction (during video step)

o a way of specifying where to stop when manually breaking (with ctrl-c)
	- so, continue to this scanline before stopping
	- set break with mouse should set this manual breakpoint rather than the
	  current behaviour (adding to the list of auto-breaks)

o a way of outputting information at a particular point if the information has
changed since the last iteration
	- for example: "player 0" at scanline 150 if changed
	- ONDIFF command?

o LAST to include additional information
	- such as, what memory address was touched.
	- defaults to CPU instruction like now but optional arguments to output
	  different LAST information. for example: LAST MEM

o CPU command to change status register

o test harness to handle more sophisticated operatio of the debugger. for
	example, making sure breakpoints are triggered and retriggered correctly.

o better breakpoint/trap target parsing
	- AddressingMode and EffectCategory should be referred to (and be
	  displayed) as a descriptive string, rather than numerically

vcs
---

o DPC+ and CDFJ cartridge formats

o randomised initialisation
	- optional to prevent regression tests from failing

o panel
	- reflect panel changes in gui. the Panel.Handle() function would be a good
	  place, probably with a callback argument rather than passing an GUI
	  interface.


regression db
-------------

o selecting tests to run by regexing NOTES field

o multiple arguments for DELETE

o a way of adding notes to an entry after it has been added

o SORT BY argument for LIST

o lock file

o CLEAN mode
	- removes entries where ROMs or script file is missing
	- removes orphaned script files

o parallel execution of tests
