debugger
--------

o custom error messages for command line package
	- for example "unrecognised argument" command for HELP should be something
	  like "no help available for ..."

o resolve symbols for WATCH command
	- and probably BREAK, TRAP commands

o a way of specifying where to stop when manually breaking (with ctrl-c)
	- so, continue to this scanline before stopping
	- set break with mouse should set this manual breakpoint rather than the
	  current behaviour (adding to the list of auto-breaks)

o a way of outputting information at a particular point if the information has
changed since the last iteration
	- for example: "player 0" at scanline 150 if changed

o confirmation of quit (on ctrl-c)

o LAST to include additional information
	- such as, what memory address was touched.
	- defaults to CPU instruction like now but optional arguments to output
	  different LAST information. for example: LAST MEM

o honour ctrl-z

o commandline
	- custom placeholders. for example:
	
		PEEK %address

	 would validate true only if it passes a custom test for %address

o display of colors in the terminal (check for 256 color terminal)

o check validity of ONSTEP and ONHALT before committing the new command sequence

o RUN without ONSTEP output or a DISPLAY should produce a warning note
