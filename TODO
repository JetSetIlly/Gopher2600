o LAST to include additional information; such as, what memory address was touched.

o honour ctrl-z

o commandline
	- custom placeholders. for example:
	
		PEEK %address

	 would validate true only if it passes a custom test for %address


o display of colors in the terminal (check for 256 color terminal)

o check validity of ONSTEP and ONHALT before committing the new command sequence

o RUN without ONSTEP output or a DISPLAY should produce a warning note
