// Package test contains helper functions for standard Go testing.
//
// The ExpectEquality() is the most basic and probably the most useful function.
// It compares like-typed variables for equality and returns true if they match.
// ExpectInequality() is the inverse function.
//
// The ExpectFailure() and ExpectSuccess() functions test for failure and
// success. These two functions work with bool or error and special handling for
// nil.
//
// All functions a return a boolean to indicate whether the test has passed. This allows
// the user to control larger test procedures that have several stages.
