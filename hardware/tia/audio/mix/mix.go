// Package mix is used to combine two distinct sound sources into either a mono

// The mono mix is created according to the information in the document, "TIA
// Sounding Off In The Digital Domain", by Chris Brenner. Announcment link
// below:
//
// https://atariage.com/forums/topic/249865-tia-sounding-off-in-the-digital-domain/
//
// The exact implementation here is an optimisation of that work, as found by
// Thomas Jentzsch (mentioned in the link above)
//
// Both 6502.ts and Stella source was used as reference. Both projects are
