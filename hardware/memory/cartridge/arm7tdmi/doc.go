// Package arm7tdmi imlplements the ARM7TDMI instruction set as defined in the
// ARM7TDMI Instruction Set Reference:

//
// For this project we only need to emulte the Thumb architecture. The strategy
// for this was to implement the nineteen opcode formats. As of writing only
// format 17, software interrupts, remain unimplemented. To this end, the
// following reference was preferred:
//
// http://bear.ces.cwru.edu/eecs_382/ARM7-TDMI-manual-pt1.pdf
//
// More detailed explanations of Thumb instruction were found in chapter A7.1
// of the ARM Architecture Reference Manual. In particular the side-effects of
// particular instructions were found in the supplied pseudo-code. Where
// appropriate, the pseudo-code has been included as a comment in the Go
// source.
